## General Information

A web application that allows users (with personalized accounts) to place bets on the results of selected sports tournaments.

Users, after logging into their accounts, have the option to place bets on the results of active matches. These results are saved to the database.

After the end of the match, the data controller imports the match results to the program, and the user has the option to check the number of points obtained from his prediction (3 points for a correct result, 1 point for indicating the correct winner or tie, 0 in other cases).

The user can read the number of points obtained in a given tournament among all his predictions.

- It is not possible to place bets on matches after their start time.


- It is not possible to duplicate the results of bets.


- Meeting results can only be added by a user with administrator privileges.


- User accounts have their own login and password (hashed).

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
